this project is created using nextjs
use "npm run dev" to start development server
i have used prisma as an orm and mongodb as database
.env file looks like this >> DATABASE_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/assesment_db"
i have mostly implemented server side logic like add company,add user , list all users with nextjs server actions mostly in server_action.ts file .
use zod for form validations;
unable to complete delete api :(
